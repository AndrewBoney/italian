italian
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This website documents my journey through italian lessons (specifically
https://www.bristolfolkhouse.co.uk/courses/italian-beginners-entry-bl11-15198).

This is partly for notetaking and partly for learning nbdev.

I think at a min I’ll use the markdown to take notes. I’d like to
formalize further if possible; perhaps seeing patterns in the language,
automating translations, perhaps audio classification. Not exactly sure
yet, will see how things progress

## Install

``` sh
pip install italian
```

## How to use

One notebook per lesson; Simples
